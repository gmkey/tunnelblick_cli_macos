## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

The last few years I've been running tunnelblick to connect certain customer and business OpenVPN servers.
One of the more annoying things for me was the inability to control Tunnelblick sessions from the command line.
Especially when you - like me - are working on several projects in a day and the customer requests to perform a quick change on their environment. 

These shell scripts were created to be used with zsh to trigger the Applescript interface provided by tunnelblick. 

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your MacOS Ventura.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.
- [MacOS Ventura](https://www.apple.com/en/macos/ventura/)
- a terminal client like [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com)
- [Tunnelblick](https://tunnelblick.net) 


### Installing

#### the Easy route

```zsh
zsh <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gmkey/tunnelblick_cli_macos/master/install_vpnconnect_shell_integration.zsh)
```

##### manually
A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo.



## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>

### integrated into your zsh environment. 
The script has 4 parameters: config, open, close and clear

#### config
```zsh 
vpnconnect config
```
will prompt you to configure your preferred OpenVPN configuration in Tunnelblick. If you don't give one it will list the configurations to choose from.

#### clear
```zsh 
vpnconnect clear
```
clears your configuration

#### open
```zsh
vpnconnect open
```
Will disconnect any running VPN sessions and connect your VPN configuration you configured as default.
```zsh
vpnconnect open <another_VPN_configuration>
```
Will disconnect any running VPN sessions and connect to the given VPN configuration.

#### close
```zsh
vpnconnect close
```
Will close the session you opened and will reconnect to the previous VPN connection.  (Ideal for short logins to external environments).
